# biodiversity-in-national-parks
This is a portfolio project as part of the business intelligence data analyst course on Codecademy. I will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks

## Project Scope
### Problem Understanding
1. **What is the problem?**
      * A number of animals national parks 
3. **Who does it impact and how much?**
4. **How is it being solved today and what are some of the gaps?**

### Goals
1. **What are the goals of the project?**
      * Identify which parks have the most observations
      * Identify the most and least spotted animals
      * Identify why some animals are endangered
      * Identify which animals are the most and least isolated (how many national parks are they in?)
      * Visualize the conservation status of each animal in the dataset

2. **How will we know if our project is successful?**
      * If we have draw conclusions from the data
      * If the information is shared in a clear and consice way (easy comprehension from the reader)

### Actions
1. **What actions or interventions will this work inform?**

### Data
1. **What data do you have access to internally?**
2. **What data do you need?**
3. **What can you augment from external and/or public sources?**

### Analysis
1. **What analysis needs to be done?**
2. **Does it involve description, detection, prediction, or behavior change?**
3. **How will the analysis be validated?**
