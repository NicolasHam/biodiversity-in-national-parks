# biodiversity-in-national-parks
This is a portfolio project as part of the business intelligence data analyst course on Codecademy. I will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks

## Project Scope
### Goals
1. **What are the goals of the project?**
      * Identify which parks have the most observations
      * Identify the most and least spotted species
      * Identify why some species are endangered
      * Identify which species are the most and least isolated (how many national parks are they in?)
      * Visualize the conservation status of each species in the dataset

2. **How will we know if our project is successful?**
      * If we have draw conclusions from the data
      * If the information is shared in a clear and consice way (easy comprehension from the reader)

### Data
1. **What data do you have access to internally?**
	 * Observations of species
	 * Information about each species
3. **What data do you need?**
	 * I have all the data I need
5. **What can you augment from external and/or public sources?**

### Analysis
1. **What analysis needs to be done?**
2. **Does it involve description, detection, prediction, or behavior change?**
3. **How will the analysis be validated?**
